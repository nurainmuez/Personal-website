		<br><b>Experience Working in a Children Nursery.</b></br>
		<br><style="font-family:Haettenschweiler;"></br>
		<br>I started working after complete my Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM). I started working in January 2018 until May 2018 and have continued
			my studies in Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia (STPM) . When I finished STPM, I started working again at the nursery in June 2020 
			until September 2020 and once again I continued my studies in Bachelor's Degree level. The experience I got while working at the ursery 
			was the ways to handle the baby properly, spread the nature of love and also teaching the children about the basics of learning as in 
			Kindergarten. It also encourages us to increase patience and wisdom in taking an action. The experience that give awareness to me was when there 
			were parents who were so preoccupied with their work when they picked up their children in the late afternoon like 7 pm and sent them off early on 6am. 
			Children do not have much time to feel the love of their parents. Sometimes, there are certain parents who request to send their child on weekends. 
			In my opinion, we can send them to the nursey when going out to work, but do not even leave them at the nursey during holiday or weekend 
			just to relax uninterrupted. This is because children also need the love of their parents.
